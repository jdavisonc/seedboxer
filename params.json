It was designed to be hosted inside a Seed Box, a remote server used to download and share content through the Internet. \r\nSeedBoxer was created to work with downloads managers like rtorrent, utorrent, trasmission. This managers need to be configured to use watch, in progress and complete folders.\r\n\r\n## How it works?\r\n\r\nSeedBoxer is based in two main features, the Mule which main purpose is distribute content to the user, and Sources which filter the user content from sources (RSSs), put them to download (download manager) and enqueue.\r\n\r\nThe Mule is a process that basically copy the downloaded content in the Seed Box to an user transport account. When the download to an user transport account was finished, a set of post actions and notifications will be executed depending on user configuration. The Mule manage the user downloads with a queue, each user has a download queue (FIFO).\r\n\r\n### File Transfer\r\n*   FTP\r\n*   Dropbox (coming)\r\n*   Google Drive (coming)\r\n*   Socket (SeedBoxer client) (coming)\r\n\r\n### Post Actions\r\n*   SSH send command\r\n\r\n### Notification\r\n*   Email\r\n*   GCM (Android Push Notification)\r\n\r\nSources is a process that periodically scan a set of sources (RSSs) and filter the entries depending on users filters. A user can configure its owm filters based on types of content: TVShows, Movies, XBOX Games, etc. Each content has its owm properties, like TVShow that can be filtered by title, quality, episode or season.\r\n\r\n### Type of Content\r\n*   TVShow\r\n*   Movie (coming)\r\n*   XBOX Game (coming)\r\n\r\n### 3rd Party Integration\r\n*   IMDB - Personalized list\r\n*   Trakt.tv - Whatchlist (coming)\r\n*   The TVDB - Favourites TVShows (coming)\r\n\r\nTo know more about SeedBoxer, go to [Getting Started](https://github.com/seedboxer/seedboxer/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n*   Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)\r\n*   Java JDK 6 (OpenJDK or Oracle)\r\n*   MySQL Server version 5.1+\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\nSeedBoxer offers access to that corpus of data, via APIs.
