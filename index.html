          <h2>What is SeedBoxer?</h2>

<p>SeedBoxer is a distribution content system based on users queues and filters; it send all the data you wants to your home server from the seed box. It was designed to be hosted inside a Seed Box, a remote server used to download and share content through the Internet. 
SeedBoxer was created to work with downloads managers like rtorrent, utorrent, trasmission; configured to use watch, in progress and complete folders.</p>

<h2>How it works?</h2>

<p>SeedBoxer is based in two main features, the Mule which main purpose is distribute content to the user, and Sources which filter the user content from sources (RSSs), put them to download (download manager) and enqueue.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CNiW9Ul.png" alt="SeedBoxer use case"></p>

<p>The Mule is a process that basically copy the downloaded content in the Seed Box to an user transport account. When the download to an user transport account was finished, a set of post actions and notifications will be executed depending on user configuration. The Mule manage the user downloads with a queue, each user has a download queue (FIFO).</p>
